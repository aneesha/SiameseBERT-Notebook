# SiameseBERT-Notebook
Quick semantic search using Siamese-BERT encodings

The SiameseBERT-SemanticSearch.ipynb Google Colab Notebook illustrates using the Sentence Transformer python library to quickly create BERT embeddings for sentences and perform fast semantic searches.

The Sentence Transformer library is available on [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/sentence-transformers/) and [github](https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers). The library implements code from the ACL 2019 paper entitled "[Sentence-BERT: Sentence Embeddings using Siamese BERT-Networks](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D19-1410.pdf)" by Nils Reimers and Iryna Gurevych.
